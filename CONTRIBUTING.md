## Reporting Issues

Please start with a clear and concise description of what the bug is, and what you
expected to happen instead.  Next, please describe in detail how to reproduce the bug.
Making the replication steps as simple and short as possible is very helpful.  Please
also include the requested version information.

## Contributing Code

For any significant change or new API, we recommend opening a Feature Request issue
and having a discussion before coding begins.

Please add tests for any code, as PRs without testing or which reduce the overall code
test coverage may not be merged.  Code should also be formatted with "black", be typed
(and pass type checking), and also pass the test suite.

Our thanks for being a contributor!
